Style guide for consistency across all DevProgress projects.

## Using the assets ##
Compiled assets such as css as well as images and fonts are located in the `dist` directory.

## Building and running locally ##

- `npm install` to install dependencies.
- `grunt` compiles all css and builds docs in `_gh_pages`
- `grunt serve` runs local server at  `localhost:4001`
